            <div class="name">Kirin</div>
            <p class="description">Kirin resembles a unicorn, though a closer look reveals that it has a lion-like face and is covered in scales, rather than a coat. The Kirin had a mane of fur as well as a bushy tail tip. Tufts of fur run down its shoulders and above its hoofs. The Kirin has black stripe like markings along its sides and legs. The beast has crimson colored eyes. Its majestic white mane and hair stand on end, as if charged with static. The monster often crackles with stray electricity.</p>
